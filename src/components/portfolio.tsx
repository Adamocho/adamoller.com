                    Water and electricity consumption monitoring software build in C# .NET Core. Created during an aprenticeship in EIB SA. (www.eib.com.pl) in Poland.

                    Also (monthly/weekly/daily) water and/or electricy usage spreadsheets are available, rendering costs tracking trivial.
